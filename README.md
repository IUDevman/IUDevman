### Hey! I'm IUDevman, but I usually go by Hoosiers.

**About**
I'm an amateur Java programmer that develops Minecraft "utility" mods for fun. Most of my experience is in Forge mods, but I've been expanding out recently to Fabric and other areas of Java. I'm always up to answering questions to the best of my knowlege. If you want to contact me, send me a message on Discord at GooberTown#7384!

**What I'm contributing to**
* GameSense- A 1.12.2 Utility Mod for anarchy-related servers. This happens to be my first project and where I've learned most my knowlege about java.
* Ares- Another "anarchy-oriented" utility mod which recently became open source. I've always been a big fan of this project, and now I've had the privilege to contribute to it.
